Search Mechanism

Users can search books using:

Barcode/QR Code Scanning:

The app scans the code using the device camera.

Extracted code (ISBN or title) is sent to the search API.

The API returns matching books which are displayed in the app.



Analytics Logic

Analytics are calculated based on local search history stored on the device.

Categories Distribution:

Counts how many times each book category has been searched.

Displayed as a doughnut chart.



Publishing Trend:

Displayed as a combined column and line chart.

Charts are updated automatically whenever the local data changes.
